Pretty Gist is a simple jQuery plugin to make the rather drab default Github embedded Gists look a little better. It also includes syntax highlighting, via the excellent bundled [Highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/), which includes many cool themes for you to choose from.

###Simple usage

The plugin has a default skin, which doesn't include syntax highlighting, which means you need to include the bundled `prettygist.min.css` stylesheet within the `<head>` of your page (or include the styles in your own style sheet), there is also a single sprite image that is referenced in the stylesheet (the Github logo and icon or two).

In it's simplest form, the plugin can be used by inserting the following into the `<head>`:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="prettygist.min.css">
    <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="jquery.prettygist.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
		$(document).ready(function(){
			$(".gist").prettyGist();
		});
	</script>
	
And then embedding a Gist into your page as you normally would, like so:

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/2902410.js"></script>
	
**Note:** in the above example all of the gists on the page will be replaced by pretty gists. You can, however, replace only one Gist at a time by referencing a Gists ID.

###Usage with Syntax highlighting

One of the advantages that pretty Gist has over your standard embedded gist is easy syntax highlighting (provided by the bundled and integrated [Highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/)). It's usage isn't much different that the simple example above:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="prettygist.min.css">
    
    <!-- Below is our theme (many more are included in the repo) -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/syntax-styles/solarized_dark.css">
    
    <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="jquery.prettygist.min.js"></script>
    
    <!-- Below is the main highlight.js include -->
    <script src="js/highlight.pack.js"></script>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
		$(document).ready(function(){
			$(".gist").prettyGist();
		});
	</script>

When those two extra files are added included, everything else is taken care of automatically and viola! Your Gist is not syntax highlighted.

###Custom options
There are currently three custom options that are supported, as lid out below:

    $(".gist").prettyGist({
        showHeader: true,
		extendedHeader: true,
		showFooter: true
	});

Setting `showHeader` to `false` will mean that no header is shown in the Gist. By default this is set to `true` to always show the header.

Setting `extendedHeader` to `false` will mean that no user information is displayed in the header of the pretty gist, by default it is set to true.

Setting `showFooter` to `false` will, self-evidently mean that the footer is not shown.

Both of these config options can be seen at the [demo url](http://www.joepettersson.com/demo/pretty-gist/).

###Contributing
1. Fork
2. Do yo' thang
2. Send pull request

**Notes and requirements for contributing:**

* All code must be linted.
* All contributions must have tests.
* You must run the build command to minify `src` before submitting pull request.

###Building and Testing
This scripts build and test process is based on the [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) toolchain, so [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [NPM](http://npmjs.org) being installed are prerequisities.

The tests are also run with [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org), so it will need to be installed first, if it isn't already, to do so in OSX with the awesome [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) package manager just run the following command:

	brew install phantomjs

 
When you have Node/NPM/Phantom installed, you can use the following commands to build the script:

	git clone https://github.com/JoePettersson/jquery-github-widget.git
	cd jquery-github-widget
	npm install
	grunt

Running the final `grunt` command will lint the JavaScript, run the tests and minify the JavaScript and CSS into the `dist` directory.

If you just wish to run the tests, you can run the following command form the project root:

	grunt jasmine
